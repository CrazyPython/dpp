include is an executable that has as input a D file with C `#include` preprocessor directives and outputs
a valid D file that can be compiled. The original can't be compiled since D has no integrated preprocessor.

The only supported preprocessor directive is `#include`.

The input file may also use C preprocessor macros defined in the file(s) it ``#include`s, just as a C/C++
program would. It may not, however, define macros of its own.

include goes through the input file line-by-line, and upon encountering an `#include` directive, parses
the file to be included with libclang, loops over the definitions of data structures and functions
therein and expands in-place the relevant D translations. e.g. if a header contains:

```c
uint16_t foo(uin32_t a);
```

The output file will contain:

```d
ushort foo(ushort a);
```

include will also enclose each one of these original `#include` directives with either
`extern(C) {}` or `extern(C++) {}` depending on the header file name and/or command-line options.

As part of expanding the `#include`, and as well as translating declarations, include will also
insert text to define macros originally defined in the `#include`d translation unit so that these
macros can be used by the D program. The reason for this is that nearly every non-trivial
C API requires the preprocessor to use properly. It is possible to mimic this usage in D
with enums and CTFE, but the result is not guaranteed to be the same. The only way to use a
C or C++ API as it was intended is by leveraging the preprocessor.

As a final pass before writing the output file, include will run the C preprocessor on the
intermediary result of expanding all the `#include` directives so that any used macros are
expanded, and the result is a D file that can "natively" call into a C/C++ API by
`#include`ing the appropriate header(s).

Example
-------

```c
// foo.h
#ifndef FOO_H
#define FOO_H

#define FOO_ID(x) (x*3)

int twice(int i);

#endif
```

```d
// foo.dpp
#include "foo.h"
void main() {
    import std.stdio;
    writeln(twice(FOO_ID(5)));
}
```

At the shell:

```
$ ./include foo.dpp foo.d
$ dmd foo.d
$ ./foo
$ 30
```

Structs, enums and unions
-------------------------

C has a different namespace for the aforementioned user-defined types. As such, this is legal C:

```c
struct foo { int i; };
extern int foo;
```

To accomodate for this, the translation generated by `include` is:

```d
struct struct_foo { int i; };
extern __gshared int foo;
```

Changing the variable name would cause linker errors. `struct_foo` is
close to C's `struct foo` (and similary for `enum` and `union`) and
since most C structs have a `typedef` anyway, it shouldn't impact user
code too much.
